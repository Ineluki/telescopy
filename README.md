# telesCOPY

A website mirroring package. Because mirroring websites should be as easy as

```js
new Telescopy({
	"remote": "https://choosealicense.com/",
	"local" : "./Data/Mirror"
});
```

and still be powerful enough to cover all edge-cases.
The default configuration is enough for one-time mirroring and does not download anything not on the target domain.

See [documentation](./docs/index.md) for in-depth configuration and examples.
