# TelesCOPY

Because mirroring websites should be as easy as

```js
new Telescopy({
	"remote": "https://choosealicense.com/",
	"local" : "./Data/Mirror"
});
```

and still powerful enough to cover all edge-cases.

The default configuration is enough for one-time mirroring and restricts itself to the target domain.

See the [documentation](./docs/index.md) for features, in-depth configuration and examples.
